When a new project starts, the entire company is a buzz. All the project team members are excited to be working on a new project and delivering to the customer. At the higher level, it means that the company is growing by working on new projects and bringing in revenue.

In the minds of the team, the project officially starts when everyone in the team meets to start the project. Most call this event the kick off meeting.

Kick off meeting are essential, especially for the key stakeholders within the team. You know the saying that first impression counts, it is the same for kick off meetings.

Kick off meeting must be held face to face. The value add from a face to face meeting versus an online meeting is incomparable. At the kick off meeting, it is essential to start the relationship building immediately, and building the relation in a face to face is much easier.

The kick off meeting must show team what the project is aiming to do. Without a clear goal already defined, the team will start doing but they may not be working towards the same goal.

The kick off meeting must be have the right participants. If the budget is available, everybody that is nominated for the project should be part of the kick off meeting, especially for those who have to deal with other teams. If you software engineers are working with the chemical engineers, get them together to form that humanistic bonds.

The humanistic aspect of the kick off meeting is critically important. If the individual in your team works well with others, the project has a much higher chance of success.
