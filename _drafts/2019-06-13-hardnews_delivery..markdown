We left Amed at about 11am. Our taxi driver has been on the road since 6am that morning. He had to depart from Jatiluwih to pick us at 10am in Amed. After picking us up from Amed, he had another three hours before returning to his home base in Jutiluwih.

Tepi Sawah lodge is located about 15 minutes from Jutiluwih. The closes town is Penebel, which is roughly 15 minute walk from the lodge.

We arrived after just after 3pm. The driver drove off the sealed road into a dirt track into the forest. The kids and us were filled with anticipation of the forest and nature that surrounds us. It did not disappoint
