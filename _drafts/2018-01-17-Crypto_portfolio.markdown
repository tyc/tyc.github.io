The latest craze or fad or sustainable interest (depends on your take on it), it crypto currency. The extremely volatile nature of it probably made it so popular among the public. Just before Christmas 2017, it got up to around 16,000 USD for 1 coin. It was only about 1,000 USD in January 2017.

So I purchased a small amount to get a feel of how the market works. As purchased more bitcoin and altcoins, I was find it difficult to keep track of the transactions, and the current amount of coins. The difficulty is due several factors, including the transaction fees, the high number of transaction and volatility of the each coin.

This post is just to document what my perfect crypto portfolio tracker would be like. 

##transactions##
1.It should be able to track the total amount of each wallet as the transaction are being made. When I purchase some XRP with BTC, the amount of my BTC should go down and my XRP wallet balance should go up. 
1.The transaction fees should be automatically calculated. Each exchange may have its own exchange fee. For Bittrex, the transaction fee is 0.25% of the BTC value. So when I purchase XRP with 100 BTC on the Bittrex exchange, I would pay 0.25 BTC. This means I am only getting 99.75 BTC worths of XRP. For a large transaction, this could be significant.
