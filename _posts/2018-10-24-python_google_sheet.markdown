I have a spreadsheet contain data. I want to get access to that data via a python script.

I found this video on youtube useful.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I2s81TsCnc][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I2s81TsCnc]

The video shows simple step by step on getting access to the spreadsheet data.

On my macos setup, I encountered a problem when installing the python packages via pip. However, when I execute the python script, it seems to be work OK.

Google's own information on using python to get access to the Google sheet data is severly lacking step by step details.
