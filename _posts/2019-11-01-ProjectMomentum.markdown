Hello Managers!

Project momentum is a measure of the pace at which the project is progressing. Without a good and sustainable momentum, your project will suffer and increases it chances of failure.

The project momentum has three distinctive phases, the beginning, the middle and the end. The first two phases are important  but the middle is critical. An ideal project will have a very short start and a steady middle. The end phase should also be a long slow down.
Once the project has started, it is  important to keep the momentum up. As the project manager, it is your job to keep momentum as the correct pace.

You can use the regular project meeting. I find a weekly project meeting which all of your team members are present is important. If the project is in a hot phase, the weekly project meeting can be strengthen by another project meeting or a daily standup. In my projects, I had a project meeting at the start of the week, and another on Thursday.

Communication is key to ensuring that the project momentum is kept up. Every one in the project needs to be reached on a regular basis.
Without the communication, the project team will feel that the accountability is missing and the pressure is lifted, it will cause an unwanted slow down in the project momentum.

How have you dealt with project momentum, did you have any unwanted changes to the project momentum?
