Recently, I switched over to a Linux machine. I was previously using a Mac Mini but that died, so that is the switch. The rest of the house hold is still an Apple house, most of the phones and tablets are Apple based. This means that getting music onto these devices are like pulling hens teeth out. 

The music can be purchased via the iTunes store directly onto the devices. However, we like to purchase the music in other places other than the iTunes store. We like to shop at Amazon music, or other music store online. It seems that getting the music onto the devices are only possible with iTunes.

When you configure iTunes to point at the location of the library, iTunes will create directory called "Automatically Add to iTunes.localized". For the music that is to be added to the library, the files are to be copied into this directory. When the next time iTunes is run, all the files in this directory will be automatically added to the iTunes library.

To get the music onto the Apple devices, you will need to use iTunes to do it. On the first time synchronisation, be careful to not lose the files on the device. I haven't worked out how to avoid this behaviour.
