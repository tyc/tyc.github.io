In recent months, there have been a big splash of interests over at Hacker News when couple of posts were put up that talks about  older folks working in tech. Someone posted [OldGeekJobs][OldGeekJobs_link] to [Hackers News][HN_story_link], it got 538 karma points with 379 comments. It obviously resonated with many folks working in tech.

In the startup world, the higher profile folks are typically in their 20s, working the extremely long hours and achieve hero status by shipping the product out the door with minimal sleep. I have to say that in my experience, these type of scenario is far and few in between. The startup world gets plenty of attention because it's successes are so enormous, but the startup world is only small part of the tech world. The tech world does more than just the greatest webapp, or the best way to serve you pizza, it also covers traditional industry such as aeronatics, automotive, medical, housing, healt, education, and the list would continue for a long time. In these tradition industry, a well traveled engineer with many years of experience is welcome and sort after.

At my current position, I am working in the automotive industry where graduate or junior engineers are quite rare. It is only when they have several years of experience do I see them show up in our corridors.  The risk of mistakes a lot higher and has a wider impact. I am not saying that the impact of the work of the younger does not have any impact, but the impact are very different between them.

My advice would be for the older folk to get out of the startup world if you are in it. If you are not in it, resist the temptation to join it. By all means, work on a side project but don't make it your full time focus. Make use of the best that you have. For most people, this is experience. Use it wisely.
