The following post was published in my [Project Management Weekly CW46](http://eepurl.com/gJeLn1) newsletter.

What is a monologue? I have a really clear example of a monologue. I was watching a rerun of Saturday Night Life. The host comes on the stage at the beginning of the show, and starts going through some jokes. I laughed a little bit at them, and the studio audience clapped and whistled at the end of joke. The host closed its opening with something like "I won't bore you further with my monologue, the guests on tonight show are ..."

I love an saying that is used to illustrate an situation incredibily well. During the week, I came across one so nicely, I tweeted it recently.
