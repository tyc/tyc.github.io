The following post was published in my [Project Management Weekly CW46](http://eepurl.com/gJeLn1) newsletter.

In many meeting of projects that I have attended, I would hear status reports from the team member that is from a different project. The team member would continue to follow up with what their next steps would be.

This is extremely common when the team member is active in more than one project, especially true if the project are similar in nature. The team member is sometimes confused of their scope. The team member must have a clear mind as to what their activities are in those projects. Without the clarity, the team member would introduce risks to the projects with his deliverables. He could deliver incorrect items for the projects. The confusion would slowly be passed onto the rest of the project team.

The only sure way of ensuring this does not happen is to only have the team member work on the one project at a time. However, in some organisation, this is not so easy to achieve. It could be due to number of reasons such as budgetary limitation or priority management.

The other benefit of having your team member working on the one project at a time is that their efforts are not shared with other projects. It avoids the complication of setting the correct priority between the projects.

How to combat this scope pollination? It is difficult. As the project manager, you have to be vigilant and be aware of the activities of the team. Of course, if the project manager is also managing different projects, this makes management of the scope cross pollination extremely difficult.
