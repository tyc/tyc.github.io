In a project work, it must starts at the beginning. There are many to kick off the project, some start with the Organisation Chart definition, while others starts off with role definitions or project vision. One thing that is needed to have a team behind you to execute the project. Without a team, your project is stagnant and will not progress.

So what do I need to ensure that the project can be properly started. Assuming that you have your team structure and roles defined, the next step is getting it staffed. This is tricky as it comes down to careful negotiations and selling the project to the team.

In the organisations that I have worked with, it has been a cross function matrix setup. I am responsible for the projects whereas other managers are responsible for the discipline functions. So when I need to staff the project with the correct team, I need to make the request to the discipline manangers. Hopefully, they can see the value in the project allocate the requested with the necessary skills. If not, you are need to prepare yourself for further negotiation or some difficult in executing a successful project.

Several strategies for getting the right team members are.

1. Adjust your expectation to the current environment of your company. If your company is operating in a situation where its resources are stretched, no matter how hard you beg, you will not get the resources you want. Adjusting your expectation will allow your to not cloud your judgement with what resources you do have.
1. Make your request earlier. The earlier you make your request, the more time the discipline managers have to evaluate your request. If you don't give them time to evaluate your request, they will not even look at it. They will not be able to pull resources out and service your project.
1. Make it clear the work packages are well defined. Nothing makes the discipline managers more upset than seeing their resources sitting around in idle. This is especially if those resources were pulled from other projects.

I am still battling to get my team resources. No dice here.
