The following post was published in my [Project Management Weekly CW47](https://mailchi.mp/aec04bdbda34/2019pwm-cw47) newsletter.

In a project work, it must starts at the beginning. There are many ways to kick off the project, some start with the Organisation Chart definition, while others starts off with role definitions or project vision. One thing that is needed to have a team behind you to execute the project. Without a team, your project is stagnant and will not progress.

So what do I need to ensure that the project can be properly started. Assuming that you have your team structure and roles defined, the next step is getting the project staffed. This is tricky as it comes down to careful negotiations and selling the project to the line managers.

In the organisations that I have worked with, it has been a cross function matrix setup. I am responsible for the projects whereas other line managers are responsible for the discipline functions. So when I need to staff the project with the correct team, I need to make the request to the line manangers. Hopefully, they can see the value in the project and allocate the requested with the necessary skills. If not, you will need to prepare yourself for further negotiation or face some difficult in executing a successful project.

Several strategies for getting the right team members are.

1. Adjust your expectation to the current environment of your company. If your company is operating in a situation where its resources are stretched, no matter how hard you beg, you will not get the resources you want. Adjusting your expectation will allow you to not cloud your judgement with what resources you do have.
1. Make your request earlier rather than later. The earlier you make your request, the more time the line managers have to evaluate your request. If you don't give them time to evaluate your request, they will not even look at it. They will not be able to pull resources out and service your project.
1. Make it clear the work packages are well defined, so when the requests are successful, the allocated resources can work on these packages immediately. Nothing makes the line managers more upset than seeing their resources sitting around in idle. This is especially if those resources were pulled from other projects.


Getting the correct resources is never an easy tasks. If you have other strategies, please let me know.
