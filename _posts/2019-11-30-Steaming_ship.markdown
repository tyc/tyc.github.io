Project momentum is a very critical indicator on how a project is progressing. I wrote about it (insert link here). Once a project is going and is under good progress, you would want to keep it going.

I love using analogies to illustrate a point.

Being a project manager with a project is very much like a captain of a steam ship. Before the ship leaves the docks, the captain checks that the crew is ready, plot the course and that the ship is in good shape. When the project manager starts its project, it checks that his team is ready, the plan is available and the everything is ready. 

The target of the ship is to bring the passengers to their destination on time and safely. Similarly, the project target is to deliver the agreed on time and within budget.

Once everything is planned, the ship leaves the docks and gather speed to crusing speed and be on the right course. During the startup phase, there is still some room for adjustments to the crew or equipment. This is also the same for the project.  Your team can change, or the plan can also be changed sligthly. These relatively small changes can be tolerated and the project can adjust itself accordingly. 

Once the ship is on the right course under full steam, any changes will cause delays, and may be some discomfort to passenger.

Same with the project. Once the project is up and running, you want the project team to focus on activities of the project. Definitely any disruptions such as new team members or new equipments will have the potential to cause the project to be over budget and delayed.

Spend the effort in setting the team, getting the team with the vision and heading the right direction is vitally important.
