The momentous event occurred a some weeks ago. The announcement of the picture of the black hole took place. That was such an amazing event. A picture was taken of something that was once thought to be impossible to take a picture of. Kudos to Katie Bouman

Another related event took place a few weeks ago, it was 10th April 2019 at 1.37pm, I replied to a tweet from @bendhalpern. He posted a two side by side famous pictures of Margaret Hamilton and Katie Bouman.

 The Yin and The Yang.

Never this I know that it got a little success.
