I am good GoodBudget to get keep control on our financials. It is a versatile tool and can be used in a variety of ways.

For us the following seems to work.

## Entering Income

1. Entered as a transaction and that goes into an account, and also into unallocated.

## Filling the envelopes

1. Fill the envelope using the unallocated rather than from a direct income.
1. Make sure the fill in all the envelope.

## Savings

1. The savings are using Annual Savings. The savings are used for things that are paid out once per year.
