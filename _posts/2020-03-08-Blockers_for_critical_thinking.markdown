For me, critical thinking is an procesw where you use some facts, emprical evidence or derived data to make a decision. The really good book by "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman describes that we have two methods of thinking, system one and system two. 

System one are for subjects that does not require much thought. A good example would be the answer to the question "How many colours are in the flag of Japan"? Without much thought, we would give the answer of two, white and red.

System two are for subjects that would require more thought and investigation before you can an answer. Follow on from the previous example, the question of "How would you describe the flag of Japan from the 1800s?"
