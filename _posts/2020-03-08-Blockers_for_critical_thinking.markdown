For me, critical thinking is an process where you use some facts, emprical evidence or derived data to make a decision. The really good book by "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman describes that we have two methods of thinking, system one and system two. 

System one are for subjects that does not require much thought. A good example would be the answer to the question "How many colours are in the flag of Japan"? Without much thought, we would give the answer of two, white and red.

System two are for subjects that would require more thought and investigation before you can an answer. Follow on from the previous example, the question of "How would you describe the flag of Japan from the 1800s?" To give a good answer, you would stop, imagine the flag for its distinctive features before a description emerge from your mouth. The thought process a little bit more involved.

In our world of engineering, most of us usually work on the one project, and on occassion, another project. If more projects were allocated, it would be difficult to handle all of the projects and be able to focus on the details. Our brains are not able to multitask and keep out productive level high.

"Juggling two tasks at a time = 40% of your productive time for each and 20% lost to context switching" - [@jorymackay](https://twitter.com/JoryMacKay)

As a project manager, not only is the number of projects under your management is a contributing factor to your ability to do critical thinking, but the amount of high and urgent tasks on your to-do list also plays a significant role.

I don't have silver bullet, but it is worth remembering what the focus here is. Is it to do work that produces quality result or is it to finish the items as fast as possible? It is important because it will give you a hint as to which items to work on.
