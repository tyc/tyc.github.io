We learned to take notes during our schooling days. It hits home its necessity when we need to refer to it in the future. When I was studying for my engineering degree, I wished that the lecturers would spend a semester explaining the tools that I need. A good note taking skill part of the arsenal.

Looking at my notes taking habits now, it could do with some improvements. I find that I would miss some of the important points, or I would spend too much to articulate the point being made. The articulation of the point is bad thing to do when taking notes, there is not enough time to do it. 

To improve my note taking habits, I need to improve in two areas that I can see so far. The first thing is to summarise the key points of the message quicker. Using some visual aids will help here. The visual aids can state urgency, team, cost of the note.

The second thing that I need to do is to increase my internal filter to judge whether the point is signal or noise. Looking back on the notes that I have taken in 2019, I would say that I have only ever referred to them once more for 35% of them. Does that mean that 65% notes are inconsequential?

What is the point of taking notes, and not to refer them again? It helps me contextualise the situation. As a project manager of a complex project with many moving parts, context and its notes are important. Over the course of the project, the context will evolve. This means that understanding evolution of the context is important.

Note taking tools and apps are the shiny objects for managers these days. There are so many options. New ones are coming out every few months. More often than not, I would write an email to myself. The email would be the notes, written as a bullet list.
