I have been a podcast listener for quite a number of years. I have found them enjoyable during my commute to office. When I was using an Andriod phone, my podcast player is CarCast [1]. It was a podcast player speciall designed for playing in cars.

The one thing that I really liked about it is the extra large icons it used for the controls. While I am in the car, my phone is usually in a cradle that is suction cupped to the windscreen. Having large icons to aim for allows me to be a little laxed with my aim.

The other thing I really liked about CarCast is that it is very simple. It does not overload you with many options on how to set it up. It simply allow you to select which podcoast you wish to subscribe, it will download during the night (this is a configuration), and you can listen to it. These are its default actions. Of course, there some configurable items such as whether to delete the episode after you have listened to it or not.

Now I am on an iPhone, there are no such podcast player available. I have tried most of the players available and non have come close to CarCast. All of the podcast players I have tried are really not suitable for usage in the car. The icons are small, there are too much information when listing the episodes and the downloading or the episodes are uncertain, to say the least.
