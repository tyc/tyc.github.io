Yesterday, I completed my first tutorial [1] on ElectronJS. It was created by @feross. It quite a simple tutorial which touches on them aim points. It will not make you a professional ElectronJS developer at the end of it, but it will give you a taste of what is possible.

It introduces the separation of the front end and the back end, and how both ends communicate with each other via the IPC. It also introduces you to the web aspects of creating the code via an HTML page, and laying out the various elements.

Coming from an embedded development background, I am very surprise as to how easy it was to hook into the services of the OS. I guess the underlying code that does the connecting to the OS is quite matured. Half the battle is understanding of what APIs are available for you to use. I say the Google is your friend here. 

What I also really like about the tutorial is the hints it gives you to learn some more. It prompts you to explore several functions and see what is possible.

One thing that I found it lacked an introduction to using the developmetn environment, but that is OK. The tutorial is focusing on the language and creating an application, not how to setup and to use the your development environment.
