Working hours for a someone is between 35 to 40 hours per week. This is 7 hours per day or 8 hours per day.

I came across a tweet by [@brunolemos](https://twitter.com/brunolemos), he said that he rather work 4 hours per day for 80K instead of 150K for 8 hours per day.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I prefer to make $80k/year working remotely 4h/day than $150k working 8 hours.<br><br>Iâ€™m available btw.</p>&mdash; Bruno Lemos (@brunolemos) <a href="https://twitter.com/brunolemos/status/1228810153945894919?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

The interesting questions are whether the productivity level are the same between the work hours, and what are expectations of the clients or the employer.

On the question of the productivity, when working on 8 hour day, I find it difficult to sustain a constant output for the entire day. At most, I would only get about 4 to 5 hours of solid and positive progress. My fear is that when the working day is a 4 hour day, my productivitiy will be even smaller, perhaps even about 60 to 90 minutes per day. If you are self employed, the other times will be taken up for other tasks for getting the next job.

On the question of the expectation, I am unsure how this is viewed. I think it would depend if his output is measured in productive hours or the closure of the work packages. It is difficul to say which is the better measure.

Personally, I would be better to be in a 8 hour per day situation. I have been working close to 30 years as an engineer or a project manager. During that 30 years, I cannot ever remember a period of time where working 4 hours a day would help me or the project. It would have killed both of us.

By the way, [@brunolemos](https://twitter.com/brunolemos) is available for hire. Check him out.
