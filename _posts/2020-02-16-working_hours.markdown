Working hours for a someone is between 35 to 40 hours per week. This is 7 hours per day or 8 hours per day.

I came across a tweet by @brunolemos, he said that he rather work 4 hours per day for 80K instead of 150K for 8 hours per day.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I prefer to make $80k/year working remotely 4h/day than $150k working 8 hours.<br><br>Iâ€™m available btw.</p>&mdash; Bruno Lemos (@brunolemos) <a href="https://twitter.com/brunolemos/status/1228810153945894919?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
