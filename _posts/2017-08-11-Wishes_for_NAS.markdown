During the start of the year, I purchased a WD My Cloud NAS device. One of the main reasons is to cover the use case of moving the holiday photos out of the phones. In the time leading towards the holidays, every thing seems to be working fine. Although it's server performance is annonying at times, it kinda works.

The summer vacation just finished. I spent a wonderful two weeks away with my family in southern Europe. As with most folks that were on holiday, the constant among us is the large amount of photos and the need to get it out of the cameras or phones and into some local storage.

The WD My Cloud NAS device seems to be very popular, and WD seems to sell plenty of units. They were also appear to be cheaper than those from other manufacturers. I bought the 2 TB version. Looking back on it, I should have investigate it further. I am not that happy with its performance.

1. Transfer rate is quite slow.
1. The corresponding App for your Android phone or IOS phone sucks and does not have consistent behaviour
1. The media server clients on phones are very few.
1. The hardware itself seems to take itself off the network and back onto the network on a regular basis.
1. Sometimes, a power on reset is needed.

For the time being, I will perserver to the WD NAS device, but I will start looking at alternatives.
