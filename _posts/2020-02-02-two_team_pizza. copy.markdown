Jeff Bezos famously said [link](https://www.inc.com/business-insider/jeff-bezos-productivity-tip-two-pizza-rule.html) that the ideal size of a team is should be just big enough to eat two pizza when getting a team takeout.

I was recently thinking that rule when I was building up my team for a new project. There is some truth in that if you only consider the size of your immediate team. These are for the team that you have direct contact with. A member of your team could have her own team.

The impact is two fold. Firstly, it is your impact on your the team. Secondly, it is the impact that your team have on you.

It is important you, as the project manager, has the correct level of impact on those working with you. 

If the team size is too big, your impact level will be too low. You are not really managing the project. You are managing a set of smaller projects that have a high chance of being disjointed and moving in their own direction.

If the team is too small, they could be too small for it to execute the project effectively. Just not enough people to do the work needed.

It is a fine balance.

On the other side, the size of the your team will have an impact on you.

If the team is too big, you will feel like you don't have any control on the project as your focus on the project is possible.

If the team is too small, your focus will not be there as you will need to get into the details to keep the project running.

At the end of the day, every one is part of a team.  Striking a good balance is important for your own sanity and your teams well being.
