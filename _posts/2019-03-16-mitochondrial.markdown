Diet and OT will play a big part is the management of Mitochondrial Myopathy. I almost said recovery but realised that there is not recovery in the sense that that it can be cured. It can only be managed to a level to sustain a reasonable quality of life.

Most sufferers are taking in the a ketodiet. I am not 100% sure why this is good for the body, but it seems to have good amount of folks trying it out.

The other diet that is followed is the Paleo diet. It is high protein and provides plenty of energy.
