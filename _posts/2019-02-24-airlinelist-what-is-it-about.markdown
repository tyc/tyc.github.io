Airline list an solution for scratching my own itch. This is good as I am customer number one. 

It started during our planning of a trip to Asia. We wanted to fly from Frankfurt to Bali, and there were many routes to take, allowing many different airline opportunities. Apart from the pricing of the tickets and the length of time of the travel, there isn't much other points about the airline that I can use for comparison. 

What if I want to know whether I can charge my phone on Bristish Airways or on Cathay Pacific? 

Can I carry more baggage on Lufthansa or on Emirates?

What are the safety records for United when compared against Qantas?

I want to be able to select the airlines I am considering. The website will list the points I am considering side by side for me to do the comparison. The website could provide some hints on what to consider during the comparison.

The answers to these questions allow me to make an informed decision as to which airline to choose.
