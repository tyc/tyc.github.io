My Intel NUC has Ubuntu installed. Before I installed it, I read that the Ubuntu has great support for it. 

To find out which Ubuntu, I did the following

    lsb_release -a

    Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
    Description:	Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS
    Release:	16.04
    Codename:	xenial

I come across this question in StackOverflow asking the same question that I need answer for. So I read it, and it sounded reasonable.

[StackOverQuestion](https://askubuntu.com/questions/598236/ubuntu-wakes-up-after-few-seconds-of-sleep)

I followed the instruction. I had two devices waking up the Intel NUC. I disabled both of them and the Intel NUC was stay a sleep.
