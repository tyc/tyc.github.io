What is a monologue? I have a really clear example of a monologue. I was watching a rerun of Saturday Night Life. The host comes on the stage at the beginning of the show, and starts going through some jokes. I laughed a little bit at them, and the studio audience clapped and whistled at the end of joke. The host closed its opening with something like "I won't bore you further with my monologue, the guests on tonight show are ..." 

He just called his opening a monologue. It was only the host speaking, the audience only clapped and cheered at each joke delivery. 

That is exactly what a monologue is. It is a one directon conversation when it is supposed to be a multi directional.

A dialogue is the opposite to a monologue. During the conversation, multiple participants would take their turn on speaking, putting opinions and views forward. Most of all, they are contributing to the collective that is the conversation.

When a monologue occurs, I would either make an effort to break the monologue by trying inject my views. If that doesn't work, I would wait until an appropriate time, make my excuses and leave. It is easier if I am not getting any value out of the monologue.

How would you handle monologues?
